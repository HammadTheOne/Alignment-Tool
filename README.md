# Alignment-Tool
Tool for pairwise alignments of Genomic Data

###
This is a tool intended to allow a user to align and explore various facets
of genomic data. 


The tool is simple and geared towards those without the prerequisite experience with Python or 
similar languages. 


It is very much a work in progress, as I improve upon my programming fundamentals I hope
this program does as well.
